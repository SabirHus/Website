    <h2>Technique</h2>
	<p>Passing is probably the most important skill to learn and understand as just one or two perfect passes could switch the whole play and lead to a goal for you. Also knowing when to make that extra pass rather than shoot would increase your likelihood to finish the chance.</p>
	<p>To pass correctly is about technique and body shape its not just shooting the ball at another person you must use the correct amount of power and understand how the player would receive the ball. You should make sure the player you pass to has an easy way to retrieve the ball and how he could move from that situation.</p>
	<p class = "passTech">You should run up to the ball at around 30 degrees (as opposed to the 45 degrees for shooting and like the shooting technique plant your foot along side the ball firmly. Lock your ankle and try to pass with the inside of your boot from middle of the toe to heel for an accurate short pass. Ensure you apply the correct power to the passes to help your teammates receive the ball.</p>
	<p>To pass over the top of a player, <i> a long range pass </i>, strike <em>under</em> the ball and bend your body at around <b>30</b> degrees to swerve the ball over. With this you should pass the ball closer to the top of your boot but in the inside. This would take more practice to perfect lofted passes and crosses.</p>
	<p>More advanced players could pass with the outside of the boot, <i> called a trivela, </i> but that comes with a lot of practice. You should pass with the opposite technique you use to curl the ball. It is important to have composure on the ball aswell and understand when and where it is best to pass the ball and when it is best to start dribbling or shooting. This comes with experience and knowledge of the game so just focus on learning the fundamentals.</p>
	<hr>
	<p>To practice you passing find someone to help you or use a wall. Then practice passing to specific locations with varied weight and distance. As you pass the ball try to speed it up and switch feet to improve control and confidence on each foot. This would improve your short range passing and allow you to pass more accurately.
	<br>
	You can then go on to passing over a longer distance and try to aim for specific points to improve accuracy and distance on your passes. You should also practice running forwards and crossing into the box with both feet as this can be very useful in game.</p>

    <h2>Scanning</h2>
	<p>With passing comes the idea of scanning and vision these 2 techniques will enhance your passing and football IQ. The first of which to understand is scanning. To scan the pitch is to understand your surroundings before receiving or giving a pass. Taking a glance around you to know where people are positioned before you take the pass so you know what your next move is.</p>
	<p>This skill takes a while to do instinctively and quickly looking at players like Messi and Xavi,<i> 2 former Barcelona players, </i> will help you understand better what it is to do. A quote from Xavi goes like <q><i>Think quickly, look for spaces. That’s what I do: look for spaces. All day. I’m always looking. All day, all day.</i></q></p>
	<p>Scanning will help you know where your next move is where the markers are where the next runs are to pass to. It opens up the game when you get good at it you only need a quick glance and you can visualise how they may move when you receive the ball. You should be scanning almost every second not only for passing but to improve your whole game.</p>
	<p>When scanning you don’t just look around you process and anticipate. You see who is around you, this will change how you may approach the pass, where to move and who to give it to all in the space of a few seconds. </p>
	<hr>
	<h2>Vision</h2>
	<p>Vision is another <b>key</b> aspect of passing that you can train but also experience helps as well as understanding your teammates. When receiving the ball after your scan you should not only look for the easy short pass but also ahead for the subtle movements your teammates may do. </p>
	<p>This could be you making eye contact of a subtle hand movement telling you to pass over the top to them to lead to a goal or even between the lines of the midfielders and defenders as a through ball for your teammates to run towards. This skill can switch the game on its head. It’s all good knowing where to pass to its another thing accomplishing the pass so learning all these skills will achieve this. Understanding your teammates movements is <em>key</em> to having great vision and completing long through balls.</p>
