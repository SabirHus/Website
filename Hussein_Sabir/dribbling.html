     <h2>Fundamentals</h2>
	 <p> Dribbling is a large component of football that can be broken down into different sectors</p>
	 <ul>
	 <li>Technical</li>
	 <li>Psychological</li>
	 <li>Physical</li>
	 </ul>

   <div class = "tech">
  	 <h3>Technical</h3>
	 <p>The first we will investigate is the technical aspect. The key to dribbling is to be comfortable with the ball and have complete control over it. It is best to keep the ball as close as possible to your feet and practise moving as if the ball is glued to your feet. You should be comfortable with the sole, inside and outside of both feet with the ball. Not everything in dribbling is skills its about ball mastery and small subtle movements.</p>

   <div class = "psych">
	 <h3>Psychological</h3>
	 <p>Before even attempting a one on one you should think about the decision you are making. Is this the best time to complete a take on and if done what is the plan afterwards. You need to be aware of your surroundings and look at the small spaces to break through and either pass or shoot. Another issue people may face is confidence you should be confident in your abilities to take someone on and even if you get tackled be determined to carry on next time.</p>
   </div>

   <div class = "phys">
	 <h3> Physical</h3>
	 <p>Using strength and technique to shield the ball is important be sure to use your arm and body to shield players away as you move. You also need to have good speed and quick feet and slight subtle movements can be enough to get past a player. Try to fake different ways and use your change of pace and quick touches to dribble past players. You don’t always need flashy skills to be good it is all down to agility and the basic skills to feint and fake players.</p>

    <h2>Feints and Skills</h2>
	<p>There are only a few skills you need to know for dribbling, <i>step overs, la croqueta and feints</i>. A lot of one on ones and dribbling is instinct and experience but you can maximise your skills. Simple skills like dragging the ball over to one side or feinting one way while tapping the ball the other way can be enough. Practicing step overs could trick a defender to not know which way you are going, mixing up your skills and movement whilst changing your pace up and down will be enough to get past players.</p>
	<p>Nutmegs can be difficult to practice but when you are able to accomplish one it can not only be embarrassing for a defender but allow you an opportunity to get past. Trying to look at the opponents’ feet and looking for the space between and when a gap opens try to attack it. Fitness and speed is also important in dribbling because even if you get past a player if you aren’t fit enough to catch the ball then it is useless.</p>
	<p>Fake shots can be <strong>very</strong> efficent throughout the attack, <i> shooting, passing and dribbling, </i> Pretending to shoot or pass could also be used to fake a defender that you will move one way but then you change pace to opposite direction to get past.</p>
