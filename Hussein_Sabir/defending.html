    <h2>Anticipation</h2>
	<p>Before you start tackling and using your strength you must first understand anticipation and movement. Before a pass is made you should be scanning around to find where the player may pass it to and try to intercept the pass just as it happens this can stop and need to tackle a player. Some of the time you may need to tackle in a one vs one situation and in this case you should jockey and tackle. Jockeying is the skill of <q>guiding</q> your opponent into a direction you want them to be in, <i>this should allow other players to track back and get in position, </i> you could then anticipate his movement and jump into the tackle. </p> 
	<p> To jockey effectively you must be in the rhythm of scanning, keeping your knees bent and weight towards the player whilst focusing the ball, <i>rather than the little tricks the player may do with the legs</i>. Slowly move closer to the opponent to the opposite side of where you want them to go (Usually towards their weaker side) when the time is correct lunge in the tackle the ball or block their pass/shot. To tackle effectively time you block just as they try to move the ball to reduce contact that could lead to a foul.</p>
	<p> You should be closing the space between you and the attacker and try to reduce their options. Being patient will allow you to anticipate movement and when the time is right lunge in to attack. <strong> Don’t jump into challenges patience is key. </strong>Sometimes your experience with the attacker can allow you to predict their movements. Always slowly approach the attacker and focus directly on the ball and keep moving and directing the attacker towards the weaker side. <i><strong>Don’t just stand their like a cone</strong></i></p>

    <h2>Tackling</h2>
	<p>Tackling can be either standing or sliding. Standing tackles should be done when you are close to the attacker and reach out and clip the ball away, <i>or take complete possession of the ball if done perfectly, </i> Tackling is all above anticipation, prediction and interception so scanning your surroundings and building your knowledge of football will help this.</p>
	<p>When going into slide tackle, <i> like the image to the right, </i> it is <em>vital</em> you don’t clip the player before the ball as this could injure the opponent and lead to a foul. To cleanly get the ball with contact you should get most of the ball before any contact is made. The perfect slide tackle should be done as a last resort when you are running after the ball or tracking back. When you predict the player will either slow down or release the ball you jump and lunge in with <b>one</b> leg and tackle the ball. <strong>Jumping in with 2 feet and studs up is dangerous and hated among the football community.</strong></p>
	<p>Using your strength and aerial ability can also help in your defending skills. If you have strength you should be using your strength to barge players of the ball to gain control of the ball as football is a contact sport this wouldn’t be a foul (If done correctly). Heading the ball is also great is stopping incoming crosses and trying to gain possession or clear the ball. To head the ball properly you should predict when the ball is on its way down and jump into the ball with your head. To be accurate the front side but sometimes <b>any</b> contact can affect the ball movement and stop an attack.</p>
