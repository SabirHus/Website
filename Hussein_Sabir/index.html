    <h2>Rules</h2>
    <p>Football is a simple game only needs a football, <i>of course</i>, 2 goals and in full games 22 players each side having 11 players. (1 goalkeeper and 10 outfield players.) However as long as both sides are even you can play. The objective is to kick the ball into the other side and stop it from going to your side. (Simple enough).</p>
	<p>I will be explaining some of the rules in <strong>professional</strong> games, however when playing amongst friends you may not use some of these rules.</p>
	<p>Carrying on with rules, usually there are 90-minute games with 45-minute halves.</p>
	<p>Pitch dimensions vary but they are roughly 120 <b>yards</b> (~109 <b>metres</b>) long and 75 <b>yards</b> (~68 <b>metres</b>) wide. Each side has a 6-<b>yard</b> (~5.4 <b>metre</b>) box next to the goal and an 18-<b>yard</b> (~16 <b>metre</b>) box surrounding that. The goalkeeper can only use their hands in this 18-yard box.</p>
	<p>Teams would have 7 substitutions that can be made at any time and a maximum of 5 substitutions in a game.</p>
	<p>Players can contact other players such as barging and using their strength and body. However, if they attack a player rather than the ball it would lead to a foul; yellow or red cards may be used, and free kicks or penalties will take place. For example, when tackling a player, they (accidently or on purpose) hit the players foot rather than the ball first. Free kicks are when the ball is placed where the foul happened, and a player can decide what to do with the ball and play is restarted.</p>
	<p>If the opposition team kicks the ball past the white line on the sidel, <i>top and bottom lines on the image</i>, there will a throw in for the team that didn’t kick it out. If the opposition team kick the ball out of play on their side of the goal, then a corner kick will take place. Where the other team will take the ball to the corner, and they can decide what they do the ball.</p>
	<p>There are many other rules and regulations you may want to research more about however the last one I will talk about is offside. When the ball is passed to a player nobody should be past the line of defence from the opposition team. For example, if a ball is passed over the top the second the ball leaves the foot of them. The player they are passing to has to be behind the last defender from the opposite team and not past them.</p>
	<p>A player cannot be offside in their half, a goalkeeper doesn’t count as a defender and lastly if the ball is passed backwards and the player is in front of the last defender this isn’t offside.</p>

	<h2>History</h2>
	<p>The actual first origin of football is debated some say it was made over 3000 years ago by the Aztecs as this was the first team game involving a round Ish ball (made of rock.)</p>
	<p>Some say it was in China from the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> centuries where they kicked the ball (made of leather) and began to spread across Japan and Asia. Some ball games were made in Aboriginal Australia, Ancient Greece and even Ancient Rome.</p>
	<p>However, the modern <q>beautiful game</q> was made in Britain in the 19<sup>th</sup> century. This was the first time <ins>professional</ins> football was played. At this time, it had different rules and slowly began to become the modern game we know over the years.</p>
	<p>Positions and roles have come a long way but some of the general ones the 11 players can be set in different positions called formations. For example, there can be a set number of defenders, midfielders, and attackers.</p>
	<p>Generally, there are Defenders Midfielders and Attackers.
	There are players that take up the wider areas and players that are more centrally in the most basic terms.</p>
	<p>These positions can be slightly different depending on the instruction of the manager, but I won’t be going into detail with these.</p>
